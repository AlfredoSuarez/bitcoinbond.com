            If you are a SME that is looking for funding for working capital, specifically inventory turnover, or taking advantage for fixing price with your suppliers, but need extra cash, check this option. It is a Bond for short term period, where the market can lend you money for a year, which at the end of period should pay $100.00 USD for each bill issued in Bitcoin. But the actual funding amount will be less and the difference is the interest rate that must be paid. For example, is ACME Co. issue a 1 bill, and according to the rating models, it states that should pay 10% discount rate, so in day 1 ACME will receive $90.00 USD and at the end of the year, must pay $100.00 USD.
